  abstract = {Mu Us Sandy Land is a typical semi-arid vulnerable ecological zone, characterized by vegetation degradation and severe desertification. Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China. However, most previous studies have used a single method or remote sensing index to monitor desertification, and lacked an efficient and high-precision monitoring system. In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial–temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67\%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74\%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators. (c) Since 2000, the area of extremely severe desertified land has shown a reversal trend; however, there is significant interannual fluctuation in the total and light desertification land area affected by extreme climate. This research provides a novel approach and a valuable reference for monitoring the evolution of desertification in regional studies, and the results improve the research system of desertification and provide a data basis for desertification cause analysis and prevention.},

  abstract = {Sea Surface Temperature is a variable recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS), due to its determinant influence on climate dynamics, from micro scale to global levels The aim of this paper is to estimate Sea Surface Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea during years 2003–2019 by using the MODIS Level 3 SST Thermal IR 8 Day 4km V2019.0. Results show an SST increase of 0.040~±~0.001 °C/yr. The seasonal maximum trend is associated to summer 0.070~±~0.001 °C/yr, followed by winter, (0.040~±~0.001) °C/yr, autumn 0.030~±~0.001 °C/yr and spring, 0.020~±~0.001 °C/yr. The total period analyzed has been divided into ten-year time spans, showing a stable increase of 0.055 °C/yr in average, from period 2005–2014 onwards. In absolute SST values terms, the parameter range is of 0.85°C from year 2005 to 2019. We have also analyzed the spatial variability of the parameter by dividing the Mediterranean Sea into nine sub-basins: Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea (Iberian Sea), Mediterranean Western Basin, Mediterranean Eastern Basin, Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea. The results show warming trends from 0.02 °C/yr for the Alboran Sea to 0.07°C/yr for the Adriatic Sea. Results have been validated by using data from a local observational buoy system, obtaining a coefficient of determination of 0.97.},

  abstract = {Eutrophication is a phenomenon that affects many water bodies around the world. In severe cases, eutrophication can lead to large algal blooms. This study presents a method to detect algae blooms based on a time series of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the period 2001-2014. This time series is obtained from a semi-empirical algorithm generated with MODIS satellite data and in situ data from the Ministry of Water Resources of Cordoba Province. By detecting algae bloom dates and their statistic characterization, it is possible to define the range of Chl-a values in which the San Roque Dam is going through a bloom event.},
